- ⚡ Fun fact: Cats are unable to distinguish between species, which causes them to consider their owners as larger, weirder cats that are able to walk on two legs. The inability to distinguish between species is why many cats adopt behaviours from other animals when growing up as well as why some cats attempt to boss their owners. They latter is done due to cats thinking of their owners as young kittens who are unable to hunt for themselves and so constantly try to teach them.
